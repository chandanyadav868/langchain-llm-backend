how does rag handle structured data so when it comes to structured data uh what you typically want to do is add another agent so the fusion retriever would probably be split into three one that's looking at the vector database one that's looking up um uh the graph graph database and then the fourth one kicks in only like the that you can put a model to decide whether the you need retrieval from the database but it'll take whatever question is coming in and create a SQL query for it okay and then launch the SQL query in the back get that knowledge and then put that context in got it so someone asked a question like how many loans have I given above $10,000 since first gen 2024 for a back yeah that the agent will first convert that to SQL saying select star from xtable and it figure out the tables soon yeah so tables like yeah the agent will have access to the table so the you know what columns are available in this table what's the dictionary all of that given to okay and then you let it flow through okay so yeah so then you'll kind of be able to answer that question very very effectively you'll get that right context in right oh these are the and then the llm presents it yeah awesome so so that's how that piece works
